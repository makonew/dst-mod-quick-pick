## Overview

The old version is here [SteamCommunity] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921270365
Which is continuation of [SteamCommunity] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=50138507

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

The mod removes the animation of harvest grass, sapling, berrybush and other things, which makes them picked like a carrot.

It makes almost everything pick quickly.
